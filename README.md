# Machine-Learning--Fraud-detection-
This project involves a Machine Learning system designed for binary classification to detect fraudulent activities. The system includes both training and testing phases using various ML models, aimed at identifying whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
Fraud detection in credit card transactions is a major challenge faced by financial institutions. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions (unauthorized or malicious activity) while minimizing disruption to legitimate users.

Credit card fraud typically involves unauthorized usage of a credit card to make purchases or withdraw money. This problem is critical because financial losses can be substantial for both the cardholders and the credit card companies.

To solve this problem, we use binary classificationâ€”a machine learning approach where the task is to classify each transaction as either:

Fraudulent (1): The transaction is flagged as fraud.
Non-Fraudulent (0): The transaction is considered legitimate.
**Dataset**:
For this project, we use a credit card fraud detection dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders, with features that have been anonymized for privacy reasons. It includes thousands of transactions, and each one is labeled as either fraud or non-fraud. The challenge with this dataset is its imbalance: only a small fraction of the transactions are fraudulent.

**Key Challenges:**
Imbalanced Data: Fraudulent transactions are very rare compared to legitimate ones, leading to highly imbalanced datasets. This makes it difficult for traditional machine learning models to detect fraud effectively.

Real-Time Detection: Fraud detection systems must operate quickly to prevent fraud from occurring or limit the damage.

Evolving Fraud Patterns: Fraudsters constantly change their tactics, so models must be able to adapt to new fraud patterns.

**Techniques:**
Machine Learning Models: Models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are commonly used to classify transactions as fraudulent or not.
Evaluation Metrics: Since the dataset is imbalanced, metrics like precision, , and F1-score are more important than accuracy, which can be misleading in such cases.
